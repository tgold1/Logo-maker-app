# Logo-maker-app

## Description 
I wanted to create a logo maker application that would help a developer generate a simple logo so that they do not have to pay a graphic designer. The thought was to have a simple application by answering four simple prompts a logo would be generated. I helped to find a quick solution for simple graphic design needs. I enjoyed using the inquirer prompts to build the options for the logo.

## Installation 
Anyone can access the application by opening it through the integrated terminal. Type on the command line node index.js to begin the application. You will answer four prompts on text, text color, a choice of shape (circle, triangle, or square), and shape. There will be a message "Generated logo.svg."

## Usage
In order to see the generated logo.svg just go to the logo.svg file on the left-side and right click on logo.svg file. Then click on preview SVG and a preview will open in the browser.

## Tests 
I used the Jest Test Suite for my application and you can run the tests by using the command npm run test in the command line in the integrated terminal.
